				+ "\r\n"
				+ "End-Point assessment (EPA) tests the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours (KSBs) that an apprentice has gained during their training. Unique to each standard, the EPA demonstrates the competence of an apprentice in their role. This competence is valued by current and future employers. As your DTS degree is integrated - the End-Point Assessment lasts for 30 minutes and involves a presentation and Q & A. This is then graded and makes up 20% of your BS3205 Synoptic Project Module grade. Further information pertaining to this, will be provided when you undertake BS3205 (see Q & A below for more details)."
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "However, it is important you have all the evidence in place prior to going to Gateway (this is held at the end of July in your final academic year) and then End-Point Assessment at the end of your 3rd (or 4th) year, this means that your EPA Mapping document needs to be completed to high standard and your Digital Portfolio also needs to be complete.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Please review the Q & A's below which may help support you on your learning journey. If you would like to add a Question to this section, please email DTS@winchester.ac.uk"
				+ "Q & A's from learners:\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "How do I complete my EPA Mapping document?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "The mapping document provided to you, is a document where you explain (in detail) what you have done to meet that standard. The standards are also commonly referred to as KSBs. You need to detail where you completed this standard at work and at university. We recommend aiming for 100 - 150 words per example (module) as a general rule of thumb. For the university column, you should try to include two examples (or one very thorough example i.e., 200 - 250 words). There should be 1 example per work example. We also recommend using the Module Code and Name as a heading in each university box i.e., BS1930 Academic and Professional Skills. You should try to include two small examples per box (especially in the university column) or one detailed example. Evidence of you achieving this standard must then be uploaded to your Digital Portfolio.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "What is the Digital Portfolio?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "The Digital Portfolio is a mandatory submission. Within this you must submit every summative you have ever submitted. You can then select any formatives as necessary.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "You submit your Digital Portfolio in your BS3205 Synoptic Project Module alongside your EPA Mapping document. The Digital Portfolio is a ZIP file, with collated pieces of evidence. When structuring your ZIP file, we recommend having two folders embedded within this entitled: University Evidence & Work Place Evidence. Subfolders within these, should correlate to what year the evidence was produced. For example, if we use the example of BS1930 Academic and Professional Skills. The module code and name, would be the name of a piece of evidence submitted for Year 1. This then means that your Digital Portfolio is easy to navigate by External Examiners - as it directly matches titles found within your EPA Mapping document,\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "What sort of evidence can I submit for university?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "There is a broad range of evidence which can be included, but this is dependent on the area of competence. For example, if you were to address Information Systems (Skills), evidence could be: A Report identifying the current business processes or Benefits analysis or Solution model. The potential evidence varies dependent on competence. To see a full list, please view your IFA DTS Standard. In particular, refer to pages 11-17.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "What sort of evidence can I submit for work? \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "As above, evidence varies depending on the type of competence for example, Screenshots, Written Reflections (signed by your line manager and yourself) [only if sensitive data, redacted evidence still must be included], Presentation Slides, Feedback from Clients/Customers/Line Managers i.e., from a project, Code, Reports, work produced from your Work Based Studies Modules (in years 1 and 2) and your Synoptic Project (Year 3/4) etc. This list is not extensive, and you may have restrictions in place depending on the nature of your placement. When your employer agreed to this apprenticeship they agreed to \"permit evidence of commercial value to be included\" for assessments as per the IFA Regulation. This means they have a duty to support you in meeting your KSBs. If you have any queries pertaining to what can be included within your work place column please do not hesitate to contact DTS@winchester.ac.uk where we can discuss this will your or arrange a tutorial as needed.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "What does the End-Point Assessment Presentation Involve?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "The presentation is a structured discussion between the apprentice, the university, external examiner and the employer, focusing on the outcomes of the synoptic project. It covers both what you as the apprentice has done, the standard of your work, and also how you have done it. This enables the assessment to include the assessment of skills, knowledge and behaviours as required by the standard.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "The purpose of the presentation is to review:\r\n"
				+ "- What you as the apprentice set out to achieve;\r\n"
				+ "- What you have actually produced in the project;\r\n"
				+ "- The standard of your work;\r\n"
				+ "- How you have approached the work and dealt with any issues arising;\r\n"
				+ "- Clarify any questions the university/employer has from their assessment of the project;\r\n"
				+ "- Explore aspects of the project work, including how it was carried out, in more detail;\r\n"
				+ "- Confirm the demonstration of appropriate interpersonal and behavioural skills.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "The presentation will be assessed as part of the overall project assessment. The University of Winchester will provide guidance on the nature of the presentation and the assessment criteria used. This will ensure that consistent approaches are taken and that all key areas are appropriately explored. The initial and primary focus for the presentation is on the work presented in the project. However, the presentation assessors can explore the apprentice’ broader experience from the workplace, to demonstrate that the skills and knowledge defined in the standard have been met. \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "I didn't meet a standard within my job therefore I can't fill in the box on the EPA mapping document, what do I do?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "At the start of your apprenticeship, your employers reviewed all the competence's you needed to achieve by the end of the programme and compared this with your Job role. Your employer confirmed that you could meet these in your job role. Therefore, we recommend you approach your employer and make sure you gain the necessary experiences required of the apprenticeship. If you have any concerns regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact DTS@winchester.ac.uk or Apprenticeshipadmin@winchester.ac.uk.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Do I have to fill in every box on my EPA Mapping Document?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "You must fill in every box on the EPA Mapping Document. This is because, the external examiners will scrutinise all the work you have submitted and gathered within your Digital Portfolio. Depending on this, and your assessment - they will grade you. As such, it is mandated that you include as much detail as possible when outlining what you have done to meet a KSB. Especially, as this can impact your overall grade. \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "I've changed my job role within the company, what do I do now?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "If you have changed job role during the apprenticeship, please email Apprenticeshipadmin@winchester.ac.uk with an updated Job Specification. The centre will then review whether you can still meet your apprenticeship KSBs. \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "What column does Work Based Studies and my Synoptic Project go in?\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Work Based Studies encouraged you to use your workplace as an example within the module, equally within your Synoptic Project you are curating and designing research to address an ostensible need for your company. Given this, we ask that it goes in the work place column. This may be particularly helpful for learners working on defence project(s) who may find it difficult to evidence work related activities, as a KSB could be filled with evidence from your Work Based Studies and Synoptic Project.\r\n"

				+ " \r\n"

				+ ">Yourself and your own personal development,\r\n"
				+ ">Industries or sectors\r\n"

				+ "\r\n"
				+ "A good synoptic project will be clearly and precisely defined to increase the likelihood of a tangible, worthwhile output, given the finite time and resources to be devoted to it. Vaguely defined synoptic projects such as 'An examination of the system of the XYZ Company' are not likely to meet this requirement.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ " \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Choosing a suitable synoptic project topic can be a bit daunting. In general, more successful synoptic projects focus upon a relatively small issue in depth rather than attempting a wide- ranging study. Your synoptic project should clearly be relevant to the way in which you have developed your thinking and passions in your degree, but it should also be relevant to your career plans. A good synoptic project can be very advantageous in enhancing your employability. Many employers regard the synoptic project as vital evidence of your employability and your ability to work independently.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ " \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Starting the process of creating your synoptic project should begin with identifying a topic you are interested in.  Remember you will be working on this project for nearly a year, so it needs to be something you will find interesting for a sustained period of time. Think about ideas that have emerged modules or challenges assignments you have enjoyed, or strengths you want to develop. Together, these will help you focus upon an idea that you would like to research.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ " \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "The golden rule for an undergraduate synoptic project is that it must have a literature base. This means that if the literature does not exist (as the emergent problem may be extremely topical) then it will be difficult to conduct a synoptic project in this area. So, it is important to read quite widely around the area to locate a starting point for the synoptic project. You should undertake specialised literature searches using the resources of libraries, particularly Emerald, science direct, Business Source Complete and Google scholar for relevant journal articles. If you use the internet you do need to exercise a degree of care as there is no ‘quality control’ mechanism for material published on the Internet as there is for more conventional academic journals and the information you access may be inaccurate or not particularly relevant (if it applies to an American rather than a British audience, for example).";
